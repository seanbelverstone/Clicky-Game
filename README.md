## Halo Clicky Game

Created using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and utilizing a theme from the popular video game series, Halo. All images were taken from Google and the Halo website.

This application is a simple clicking game, where the user is required to not click the same image twice! When one picture has been selected, the board shuffles the images. The user's score is shown. Try and beat the top score!

The Clicky Game is built using vanilla Reactjs, without any other packages.
